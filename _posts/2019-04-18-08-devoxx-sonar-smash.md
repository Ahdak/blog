Talk de __Helen Wallace__ @helenfindslife et __James Mac Mahon__ @jmacrac de Murex Dublin.


# Abstract
Have you ever run code quality analysis on a legacy code base?
How much technical debt did you have?
SonarQube can be an invaluable tool for providing visibility on the quality of your code base. But when it reports 6 years of technical debt, where do you start? Often issues are tucked away in seldom visited corners of the code base, hiding real bugs.
How do you know which issues to fix? How do you get time to fix code that isn’t necessarily broken? How do you motivate developers to work on messy code?
In Murex, we created Sonar Smash: A competition to crack the mountain of technical debt, thus motivating developers to fix these issues and to write new tests WITHOUT taking away from their day to day work.
Come and learn how to run it yourself!
Whether you have 2 days or 20 years of technical debt; Sonar Smash will
* Get rid of the bed bugs in your code
* Raise awareness of code quality
* Help you identify and pitch larger refactoring projects
* Get a grip on legacy code in a meaningful way
Be Fun!

# Notes

Fuelling the removal of technical debt through competition

Legacy code
- Untested
- Confusing / unclear

### Metrics :
- Smels
- Black Duck
- Jacoco (code coverage)
- Fast feedback
- Metrics

> Found something that engages every one and make it fun —> Make competition

## Quick wins
- Filter metrics
- Update sonar rules
- Detect dead code

### How to build competition ?
- Don’t do it rule by rule base
- Do it class by class level
- Team based competition (Other person that sprint team)
- Every body loves comebacks

### When
- Every day

### Feed back
- How to explain to other persons
- Motivating developers : How to motivate ? (free launch)
- Challenge trash tag
- People want this to happen
- Visibility of competition
- Winner in Demo
- Being a part of a team
- Developers like to code
- Competition was fun

### Focus effort
- Trust developer
- Let developer choose their class to clean
- Select using Sonar
- Code Maat : Class changing almost the time
- List class to be refactored
- People assign refactor to themselves

> Make many competitions and envolve even non technical

> Make it fun to work !
