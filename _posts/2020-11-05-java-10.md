# API updates 

## var - Type inference

One of the most visible enhancements in JDK 10 is type inference of local variables with initializers. The compiler infers the type.

```java
        String name = "Before Java 10" ;
        var name = "After Java 10" ;
```

## Collections

- `copyOf()` for List, Set and Map
- `toUnmodifiable()` on `Collectors`
- `Optional.orElseThrow()` throws `NoSuchElementException` by default

# Container Awareness

VMs are now aware of being run in a Docker container and some options have been added :

- XX:InitialRAMPercentage
- XX:MaxRAMPercentage
- XX:MinRAMPercentage

# Performance

- Parallel Full GC for G1 to improve worst-case latencies.
- Application Class-Data Sharing to optimize startup time and memory footprint when multiple JVMs share the same archive file
- Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler
- Easier SSL With OpenJDK
